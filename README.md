# Description

This is a chat application built using React, Tailwind, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to chat in real-time with each other, and supports multiple rooms for users to join.

## Mission Statement

At our core, we believe that developers are more productive and successful when they can easily collaborate and share knowledge with their peers. TechChat provides a seamless and intuitive platform for developers to connect with each other, discuss ideas, share code snippets, and solve problems together in real-time. 

We strive to create a community of passionate and skilled developers who can work together, learn from each other, and ultimately build better software.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using Socket.IO
- Multiple rooms for users to join
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Technologies Used

TechChat was built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js
- Socket.IO: A library for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server

# Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Change directory to the `client`directory by running `cd client`
3. Install client dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Start the client by running `npm start` in the client directory
5. Change directory to the `server` directory by running `cd ../server`
6. Install server dependencies by running `npm install`
6. Start the server by running `npm start` 

The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`, and the client will start running on `http://localhost:5000`. Open the client URL in your web browser to start using the chat application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `client`: Contains the React client application
- `server`: Contains the Express server application
